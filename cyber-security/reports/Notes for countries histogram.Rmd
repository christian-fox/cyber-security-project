```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


I decided to use data for the students detected country. 
```{r }
# add "head(cse$detected_country)" here.

cse = read.table('cyber-security-1_enrolments.csv', header=TRUE, sep=',')
cse.df = data.frame(cse)
head(cse.df)


```
I made a histogram for this:
```{r}
# add 1st histogram

```










```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
